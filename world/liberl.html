            <h1> Estelle Bright </h1>

            <ul>
            <li> Age: 19
            <li> Hometown: Lorent
            <li> Occupation: Level-B Bracer
            <li> Relationship: Cassius Bright (Father), Joshua Bright (Brother & Boyfriend)
            </ul>
            
            <p>As a person, Estelle is a rather naive and straightforward girl who is always energetic and positive. She is very proactive, somewhat of boyish in appearance and attitude, and has a "hit first and ask later" attitude. Later, she comes to show that she can be just as girlish as Joshua would have thought of her to be.</p>

            As a person, Joshua is a quiet, calm youth whose character is the opposite of his hot-headed foster sister, Estelle. He addresses situations in a collected matter, all the while keeping Estelle from getting into trouble. Joshua is a popular figure among all those who he meets due to his calming personality as well as his careful approach to others, leading him to have many suitors, as well as a personality which draws allies to him.
            <br>His kind persona was always with him even since childhood, until the incident in Hamel. From there on, Joshua became a ruthless and merciless killer, feeling no emotion or remorse when he went out on missions for Ouroboros. A part of this was due to the trauma of losing his loved ones in Hamel, but mainly this change occurred due to interference from Weissmann.
