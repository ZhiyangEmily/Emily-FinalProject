# Emily's Final Project
The final project created by Zhiyang for MSTU5003(Fall19) at TC

# Proposal

## Summary
My project will be an unoffical commercial website for a Japan RPG game series <em>The Legend of Heroes: the Trails Series (英雄伝説シリーズ:軌跡)</em>. It will contain mainly 5 parts: Home, Introduction, character, system (battle) and product page. It is expected to be an unoffical portfolio for the series which provides news & information for existing and new players.


## Inspiration:
<em>The Legend of Heroes</em> is a series of role-playing video games developed by Nihon Falcom. Initially issued in 2004, its "Trails Series" now includes three meta series "Trails in the Sky", "Trails from Zero" and "Trails of Cold Steel". Personally, I have been playing this series ever since 2009 and is still a big fan of its storyline, characters and gaming system. However, because the series is not so notable in western cultures and Nihon Falcom is only a small company in Japan, its official website all written in Japanese and each game in the series has a separate website for commercial convenience. Since all the games in this series are correlated, the idea of building a official website for it came to me. I want to integrate information in all three series and translate them into English so more people would be able to read, play and enjoy.

## Process:
I have tried and learned some Html, CSS and JavaScript basics in my resume. I like how these computer languages can create neat layout and pleasant aesthetics, and I am still working on how to make some elements more interactive and interesting than a somewhat static and boring website. I think the aesthtic style and interaction I will put on my project should be compatible with what I intend to convey to my audience. By allowing my audience to interact with this website by simply scrolling, hovering and clicking, I would like them to feel the liveliness of the characters and the fun of watching and playing along the storyline.
Technically, I think I still have to work more on JavaScript and how it can be linked smoothly with my website. I would like my website to contain those elements from the websites above, and share same aesthetic with the original offcial website.

So the steps for me in upcoming weeks would be:
<li> learning more from class and turtorials about different interactive effects </li>
<li> start to prototype my website </li>
